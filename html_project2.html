    <h3>04/08/2025</h3>

    <p>Is it really August already?</p>

    <p>Hi hi hi oh my god Janhavi!<br />
    It's August and it's getting so much closer to you going to the USA. I am so very excited, I can’t imagine how wonderful and life altering this is going to be for you. Actually no, I keep imagining it. Even being here in MIT Manipal promises so much change; to see you in a place that was made for someone like you— with so much innovation, so many dreams, so many questions and brimming curiosity; I just can’t wait. God i'm so proud of you, its just insane.

<br />
    But then again I remember we probably won’t see you for 4 years and then I try to un-remember that :D</p>

    <p>I’m going to tell you about Manipal, it has been so much.</p>

    <h5>1. THE PLACE</h5>

    <p>It is gorgeous, it's so pretty it is a problem. I’m from Coorg, I’m not sure if I have mentioned that, and Manipal is surprisingly similar in flora and fauna. There is kessa, this leaf that my grandmom used to cook all around! Well, fauna at least. Everywhere is green, everything is covered in moss, it's hot, blazing hot like you are being roasted just seconds before you are drenched (the umbrella is your primary lifeline). It really reminds me of being back in my grandmom’s old house, it is really exactly like Coorg in so many ways, which makes me feel like I’m on a perpetual vacation! I really am not able to comprehend that I am not, and I have to study and do stuff, not just eat ice cream all the time.</p>

    <p>Manipal as a university, MAHE, was such a shock to see - I’ve heard this was a university town, but I don’t think I really comprehended that as well. This whole town, Janhavi, is MAHE! There are no borders to the MAHE campus, it spans the entire town. MIT (the technological college) by itself is 313 acres! MAHE has a total of 22 colleges in Manipal I think, and about 700 acres of land owned by it. But honestly, even the government-owned lands are emotionally MAHE’s. Imagine walking around a city and all you see is college kids and professors, and teachers and children; and faculty (shop owners, maintenance, etc.)?</p>

    <p>We stayed at a hotel with my parents when we first came here. The staff were super kind and in a couple of days we got well acquainted with them. This one time when we were having lunch, my mum was talking to me about how there are no fruit shops nearby for me and the waitresses came and told us the local places near MIT; because they are all MAHE hospitality 2nd years interning! We then spoke to the manager and he was a fourth year recent graduate. When I went to get my eyes checked, I got it checked by a 3rd year Kasturba student. She was very sweet :)) <br />
    You can talk to almost anyone on the street, because they almost certainly are MAHE students. We all always smile at each other :D</p>

    <p>The only sad thing about this is because we have such a huge campus, it gets a bit daunting. MIT is 313 acres, so while it is expansive and my morning jogs are more like morning adventure exploration time where I question my survivor skills; it certainly is hard to feel cozy and like your own little place in the world. <br />
    The other thing that bothered me the most was that it kind of prevented students in different colleges from interacting much with each other—it's a 15 minute walk always. So I rarely chance upon a kid with Artemisia Gentileschi books or a communication kid with a radio start up or a bio kid who can make me feel all envious. It's all engineers! :(</p>

    <h5>2. I NEVER HAVE TIME</h5>

    <p>I love their motto here man.</p>

    <p>(07/08/2025 I’m sorry I got really busy :( but hey here’s evidence for what I was talking about!)</p>

    <p>We had a week-long Student Induction Program (they were called SIP programs and I got really excited that they would teach us how to make money haha. But no investments here :( ) Our maths teacher, who is part of student welfare, was explaining all the many many activities, clubs, projects and interactions we have here. And then she said, (I’m paraphrasing) <br />
    “We like to keep you all as busy as you can, doing as many things as you can, thinking and solving as much as you can, because that keeps your brain from thinking all of its very hard to handle thoughts.” <br />
    And as someone who obsessively listened to music in every free second I had last year to quiet my mind down, I felt very validated. And I’ve kind of thrown myself into that mindset here; and man Janhavi I’ve never lived by it so well.</p>

    <p>Manipal has a pretty relaxed schedule compared to other engineering colleges in India; with my Tuesdays being just 2 classes after lunch! In their words, they prefer kids to have a lot of time outside classrooms too, for thoughts, projects, solving etc. because learning isn’t very active in an only lecture format. <br />
    And yet, it is quite hard to find even 20 minutes alone with nothing to do ever. <br />
    With exercise, walks to and fro classes, to the food courts to have food, the cultural expos every day, the projects, the research you can go see, the group activities you got to do, the walking, the making sure you go get good tea/coffee in the good places, doing your laundry and maintaining your room, the walking to the library, and the walking to talk to your professors, the catching ups and many birthdays;<br />
    You crash out on your bed at about 10 every night. <br />
    And this doesn’t even include the non-essentials.</p>

    <p>And you are never alone! Go to the gym, go to the library, go to the cafeteria, the food courts; there is always someone there to do what you are doing. And honestly, that constant social support is really comforting in a way. Even if it's new, scary people.</p>

    <p>And yes, I really just don’t think as much anymore. I simply don’t have the time, nor do I have the reason to. Whether it's awful thoughts I don’t know what to do with, or just a general anxiousness about my college choice, what people think of me, what life is going to be like, did I mess up? I simply don’t have the time for it. When I do find time, I desperately use it to try and get in a little bit of drawing, a little reading, even some time to do my nails. <br />
    Also, yes, I’m walking A LOT, MIT is huge; and with 10k steps each day, I sleep better than most babies I know.</p>

    <h5>3. I MEET SO MANY TYPES OF PEOPLE</h5>

    <p>I went to meet my friend recently with a terrible cold, and told him I’d get him some hot spicy soup or hot water to soothe his throat; and he point blank refused. He ended up having cool water—to calm his throat, and curd to get through the day. More confusingly, many of his North Indian friends agreed with him! <br />
    Yesterday, we had gulab jamun and ice cream as our dessert for the night; and so many people had never thought of that combination. <br />
    People here have never heard of holige!!</p>

    <p>I think I touched upon this when I was speaking to you; but this really is a highlight of coming here. Bangalore has always been multicultural, but at the end of the day, we all Bangaloreans—the mildly uncultured homogenous mixture. Here I meet people not only of different languages, but of wildly different beliefs and ideologies. I love hearing especially North Indians speak about their festivals, they actually celebrate with so much joy and love. <br />
    I sit with this Delhi-born and bred group of people for dinner, and while I feel mildly left out with my broken Hindi, I love it. They are like a different brand of people—the way they talk, the energy they have, the jokes they make.</p>

    <p>You can always also find people with every interest in mind. Yesterday I met a guy whose complete family is steeped in Carnatic sangeetha and it was lovely to talk to him. My neighbour loves skating professionally, and this one girl and guy taught me all about anime. My one friend has been coding since he was 6 years old, and my other friend plays the violin—she really really truly dreams about being a musician. She knows so much culturally about music too. I spoke to this one guy about investments for so long, he seemed to have a life’s worth of knowledge. This guy Chiranjeev and I cry about our lack of access to baking and cooking everyday. My friend Swara has been going to the gym for almost two years, she teaches me everything.</p>

    <p>I am, though, always scared that I will miss out on these people. Scared that if I don’t talk to enough people, don’t ask the right questions, don’t meet them at the right time, I will miss out on the best people, just around the corner. There is too much to try, and too little time. <br />
    But that’s just it—there really isn’t too little time; there is twice the amount of time I had with you.</p>

    <p>Disha and I are always talking about how much NPS changed us. How much confidence it gave us, how much social skills we learnt, how much we learnt that there is so much good out there that we’ve just not come across yet. Like each other too—I love having Disha in my life, but she technically was there all the time. I just hadn’t turned that stone yet.</p>

    <p>It’s going to be so much for you. You’ll be meeting genuinely the most fascinating people from all over the world. There is so much you can learn, see, be surprised by, be fascinated with. So many stones, pretty shiny ones that we’ve never seen before, for you to turn. It may also be so so much more overwhelming than it was for me. But man, am I excited.</p>

    <h5>4. I'm going to stop now because I really do not want to flood you with information!</h5>

    <p>I’ve really got to stop because I will not stop having things to tell you. The classes, the food, the labs and workshops, the projects and the people doing them, the international students, studying and engineering, the clubs, social work and waterfalls, marathons and the daunting realization that you truly are no longer a kid now, my dream of an aunt and just how much I miss you all sometimes; I couldn’t stop talking. <br />
    Oh and ice cream!! Turns out Mangalore and Udupi are some sort of ice cream paradise. This place was the birthplace of many ice cream brands and people here LOVE ice cream. There is ice cream everywhere! Ice cream posters, ads, it’s just how you show love for living in MIT &lt;3</p>

    <p>Some tiny things I should just tell you—<br />
    My physics teacher got distracted from class because there is a guy called Albert in our class; and he just had to take 10 minutes off to talk about just how much he loves Albert Einstein &lt;3</p>

    <p>I got elected to be student representative for my group of students in the student council!<br />
    I’m running my first marathon in 3 days :D You are such an inspiration Janhavi I dragged all my friends too.<br />
    I met this girl from Kenya and she has already released 3 research papers. She is the coolest!<br />
    I missed my deadline for joining ACM because I got too engrossed in answering the quiz questions yesterday :( but it was fun and I still have ACMW.</p>

    <p>I’m going to attach some photos and videos for some visual storytelling.</p>
